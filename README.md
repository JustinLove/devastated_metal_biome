# Devastated Metal Biome

Additional biome - this one isn't shipped with the game, and a server mod will be required to play it.  Repo is client mod currently; change the type and identifier if you are copying it over.

Devastation varies with water height; if you convert a regular metal planet it has water height 0 and you won't see any craters.
